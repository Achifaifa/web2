  Hi! I am Yuri (Achifaifa), and I am currently available for hire.<br><br>
  I have experience in system administration, programming, industrial maintenance and freelance consulting. A list with some of my personal tech-related projects is available <a href="./projects.html">here</a>. <br><br>
  My skills include tech support and communication, both in writing and by phone. I speak fluent English and Spanish and I will welcome the chance to learn additional languages if the opportunity arises.<br><br>
  I also have a long list of miscellaneous personal interests, including chemistry, development of computer and board games, electronics and mechanics, flight and simulation, history, music, tailoring and endurance sports.<br><br>
  Whilst I am open to any interesting assignment in any field, here are some of my preferences:
  <br><br>
  <center>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th width="50%">I would like</td>
      <th width="50%">I will not</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        To be responsible for tasks that allow me to learn something new, and to be trusted to complete those tasks with minimal management overhead.
      </td>
      <td>
        Work for governments, military/defense or other ethically questionable businesses (gambling, surveillance, facial recognition, internet ads and spyware, organized religion, extremist groups, etc).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        To work remotely whenever possible.
      </td>
      <td>
        Relocate to certain countries including China, Iran, Israel, Russia, UAE and the US.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        To work in a well organized, inclusive team.
      </td>
      <td>
        Accept an assignment or a job if there are no quality standards or if I will be asked as a norm to deliver a sub-par solution.
      </td>
    </tr>
  <table>

  <br><br>
  I am also available for comissions and collaborations, research work, consulting, and other arrangements. 
  <br><br>
  If you have a question, want to hire me or if you want me in your team full time, write me an email to<br/>[yuri (a) achi (.) se]
  <br><br>
  I do freelance work at reduced rates for NGOs, non-profits, social collectives and individuals in difficult situations, provided they do not meet any of the exclusion criteria mentioned above.
