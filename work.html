  Hi! I am Yuri (Achifaifa), and I am available for hire.<br><br>
  I have experience in the areas of programming, system administration, industrial maintenance and freelance consulting. I like to approach problems from an eclectic multidisciplinar perspective, therefore I constantly try to apply what I learn into as many other areas as possible. A list with some of my projects is available <a href="./projects.html">here</a><br><br>
  I also have experience within tech support and communication, both in writing and by phone. I speak fluent English and Spanish.<br><br>
  Whilst I am open to any interesting technical assignment in any field, here are some of my preferences:
  <br><br>
  <center>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th width="50%">I would like</td>
      <th width="50%">I will not</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        To be responsible for tasks that allow me to learn something new, and to be trusted to complete those tasks with minimal management overhead
      </td>
      <td>
        Work for government, military/defense and other ethically questionable business (gambling industry, surveillance technology, internet ads and spyware, organized religion, extremist groups, etc)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        To work in a well organized, inclusive environment
      </td>
      <td>
        Relocate to China, Iran, Israel, UAE or the US
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        To have flexible schedules and the option to work remotely, whenever possible and within reasonable boundaries
      </td>
      <td>
        Accept a job where there is no quality standard or where I will be asked as a norm to deliver a sub-par solution
      </td>
    </tr>
  <table>

  <br><br>
  I'm also available for comissions and collaborations. 
  <br><br>
  If you have a job or question for someone like me, write me an <a href="mailto:yuri@achi.se">email</a> so we can arrange a phone or video call. 
  <br><br>
  I'll work at reduced rates for NGOs, non-profits and similar organizations, provided they fit on the previous conditions.
